subtitle: Using jambonz to connect custom telephony to Deepgram's conversational AI
---

<Note>
The jambonz application referenced in this article can be 
found [here](https://github.com/jambonz/deepgram-voice-agent-example). 
</Note>

This is an example jambonz application that connect to Deepgram's Voice Agent and illustrates how to
build a Voice-AI application using jambonz and OpenAI.  

## Authentication
To use this application, you'll need a Deepgram API key. 
Set the api key as an environment variable before launching the application, like so:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<api-key> npm start
```

Replace `<api-key>` with your actual Deepgram api key.

## Configuring the assistant

With Deepgram, there is no "agent" that you need to create on their platform.  You do, however, get to 
specify in your application the LLM model you want to use, as 
[shown here](https://github.com/jambonz/deepgram-voice-agent-example/blob/8b7fb51972d9f16e400eacc34b3ac7bb06fcce90/lib/routes/voice-agent.js#L48) 
and described [here](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-llm-models) in the Deepgram docs.

You can also specify the [STT model](https://github.com/jambonz/deepgram-voice-agent-example/blob/8b7fb51972d9f16e400eacc34b3ac7bb06fcce90/lib/routes/voice-agent.js#L45) 
in the `think` property and optionally a [TTS voice](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-tts-models) in the 
`speak` property.

Finally, you provide [client-side tools](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agents-function-calling) as 
shown in the example [here](https://github.com/jambonz/deepgram-voice-agent-example/blob/8b7fb51972d9f16e400eacc34b3ac7bb06fcce90/lib/routes/voice-agent.js#L54).

## actionHook properties

Like many Jambonz verbs, the `llm` verb sends an `actionHook` with a final status when the verb completes. 
The payload includes a `completion_reason` property indicating why the `llm` session ended.
 Possible values for `completion_reason` are:

- Normal conversation end
- Connection failure
- Disconnect from remote end
- Server failure
- Server error

Ensure all environment variables are properly configured before starting the application.
