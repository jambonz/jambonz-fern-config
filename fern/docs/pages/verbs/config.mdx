| actionHookDelayAction|object, see [here](/guides/features/handling-action-hook-delays) for details.|no|
| bargein|this object contains properties that are used to instantiate a 'background' [gather verb](/verbs/verbs/gather).|no|
| bargeIn.enable| if true, begin listening for speech or dtmf input while the session is executing other verbs.  This is known as a "background gather" and an application to capture user input outside of a [gather verb](/verbs/verbs/gather).  If false, stop any background listening task that is in progress.| no|
| bargeIn.sticky | If true and bargeIn.enable is true, then when the background gather completes with speech or dtmf detected, it will automatically start another background gather.|no|
| bargeIn.actionHook | A webhook to call if user input is collected from the background gather.| no |
| bargeIn.input |Array, specifying allowed types of input: ['digits'], ['speech'], or ['digits', 'speech']. | yes |
| bargeIn.finishOnKey | Dmtf key that signals the end of dtmf input. | no |
| bargeIn.numDigits | Exact number of dtmf digits expected to gather. | no |
| bargeIn.minDigits | Minimum number of dtmf digits expected to gather.  Defaults to 1. | no |
| bargeIn.maxDigits | Maximum number of dtmf digits expected to gather. | no |
| bargeIn.interDigitTimeout | Amount of time to wait between digits after minDigits have been entered.| no |
| boostAudioSignal| A string or integer value indicating the number of decibels to boost or reduce the strength of the outgoing audio signal to the caller/called party, e.g. "-6 dB". Note this applies to the main track only, not to any [dub](/verbs/verbs/dub) tracks.| no |
| fillerNoise | play audio to the caller while the remote application is processing gather transcriptions. This is a session-wide setting that may be overridden at the [gather verb](/verbs/verbs/gather) level. See [Using filler noise](/guides/features/filler-noise) for more details.| no |
| fillerNoise.enable | boolean, whether to enable or disable filler noise | yes |
| fillerNoise.url | http(s) audio to play as filler noise | yes |
| fillerNoise.startDelaySecs | integer value specifying number of seconds to wait for a response from the remote application before playing filler noise | no (default: play immediately after sending results) |
| listen | a nested [listen](/verbs/verbs/listen) action, which allows recording of the call from this point forward by streaming the audio to a remote server over a websocket connection | no |
| notifyEvents | boolean, whether to enable event notifications (verb:status messages) over websocket connections.  Verbs that are sent over the websocket must also contain an "id" property to activate this feature.|no|
| onHoldMusic | string, provides the URL to a remote music source to use when a call is placed on hold|no|
| recognizer | change the session-level default speech recognition settings. See [the transcribe verb](/verbs/verbs/transcribe) for details on the `recognizer` property.| no |
| reset | string or array, resets either 'recognizer' and/or 'synthesizer' to the default application settings|no| 
| record|options to manage [call recording using SIPREC](/guides/features/siprec-client)|no|
| record.action|"startCallRecording", "stopCallRecording", "pauseCallRecording", or "resumeCallRecording"|yes|
| record.siprecServerURL|sip uri for SIPREC server|required if action is "startCallRecording"|
| record.recordingID|user-supplied string to identify the recording|no|
| transcribe| a nested [transcribe](/verbs/verbs/transcribe) action, which allows a transcription of the call to be sent in the background | no |
| transcribe.enable| boolean, if true start the transcribe, if false stop it | yes |
| transcribe.transcriptionHook| the webhook/websocket identifier to send transcriptions to | yes if enabling transcription |
| transcribe.recognizer| [recognizer](/verbs/verbs/recognizer) options | no |
| sipRequestWithinDialogHook|object or string, a webhook to call when a sip request is received within the dialog (e.g. an INFO, NOTIFY, or REFER)|no|
