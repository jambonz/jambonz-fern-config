## Parameters

<ParamField path="actionHook" type="string" required={false}>
  A webhook invoked when the operation completes.  
  See below for specified request parameters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="bargein" type="boolean" required={false}>
  If true, kill playback immediately when the user begins speaking.
</ParamField>

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="eventHook" type="string" required={false}>
  A webhook to invoke when a Dialogflow event occurs, such as an intent being detected or a speech transcription being returned.  
  The response to the event hook may contain a new Jambonz application to execute.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lang" type="string" required={true}>
  Language to use for speech recognition.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="noInputEvent" type="string" required={false}>
  Name of the Dialogflow event to send in query when no input timeout expires.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="noInputTimeout" type="number" required={false}>
  Number of seconds of no speech detected after which to reprompt.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="passDtmfAsTextInput" type="boolean" required={false}>
  If true, pass user DTMF entries as text inputs to the Dialogflow bot.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="thinkingMusic" type="string" required={false}>
  A URL to a .wav or .mp3 file to play as filler music while the Dialogflow back-end is executing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tts" type="object" required={false}>
  If provided, audio prompts will be played using text-to-speech rather than the Dialogflow-provided audio clips.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tts.gender" type="string" required={false}>
  (Google only) MALE, FEMALE, or NEUTRAL.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tts.language" type="string" required={true}>
  Language code to use.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tts.vendor" type="string" required={false}>
  Speech vendor to use: Google, AWS (alias: Polly), or default (for application default).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tts.voice" type="string" required={false}>
  Voice to use. Note that the voice list differs depending on whether you are using AWS or Google. Defaults to application setting, if provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="welcomeEvent" type="string" required={false}>
  An event to send to Dialogflow when first connecting; e.g., to trigger a welcome prompt.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="welcomeEventParams" type="object" required={false}>
  An object containing parameters to send with the welcome event.
</ParamField>

#### actionHook properties

The *actionHook* webhook will contain the following additional parameters:

- `dialogflowResult`: the completion reason:
    - `redirect` - a new application was returned from an event webhook
    - `completed` - an intent with `end iteraction` set to true was received from dialogflow

#### eventHook properties

The *eventHook* webhook will contain two parameters: `event` and `data`.  The `event` parameter identifies the specific event and the `data` parameter is an object containng event data associated with the event.  The following events are supported:

- `intent`: dialogflow detected an intent
- `transcription`: a speech transcription was returned from dialogflow
- `dmtf`: a dtmf key was pressed by the caller
- `start-play`: an audio segment returned from dialogflow started to play
- `stop-play`: an audio segment returned from dialogflow completing playing
- `no-input`: the no input timer elapsed with no input detected from the caller

Please refer to [this tutorial](/tutorials/#building-voicebots-using-jambonz-and-dialogflow) for a detailed example.

### call transfer in Dialogflow

Call transfer from a dialogflow bot is achieved by responding to an eventHook with event `intent` by returning a new jambonz application containing a [dial](#dial) verb.  Of course, this should only be done if the intent is signaling a request for a call transfer.

Indicating a desire to transfer the call to a live agent can be done in a couple of different ways in the dialogflow editor:

1. By adding a Dialogflow Phone Gateway Response to the intent, with a Transfer Call action.  
1. By adding a custom payload in a response to the intent, with arbitrary JSON content that you define and which should include the telephone number (or registered user, or sip endpoint) to transfer to.

> Note: option 1 only works when transferring to a US number, because the dialogflow editor only accepts US destinations.  To transfer to non-US destinations, use option 2.

In either case, your application is responsible for having an eventHook that parses the intent (found in the `data` property of the webhook content) in order to check if call transfer is being requested, and if so responding with a new jambonz application.

For instance, when the Dialogflow Phone Gateway Response is used (option 1 above), the code snippet below shows where to find the transfer number in the intent data provided in the eventHook.

```js
const evt = req.body; 
if (evt.event === 'intent') {
    const qo = evt.data.query_result;
    const transfer = qo.fulfillment_messages.find((fm) => {
      return fm.platform === 'TELEPHONY' && fm.telephony_transfer_call;
    });
    if (transfer) {
        // a transfer has been requested
        // transfer.telephony_transfer_call.phone_number has the phone number to transfer to
    }
}
```
