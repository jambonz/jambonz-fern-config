overridde it by specifying a [recognizer](/verbs/verbs/recognizer) property.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="actionHook" type="string" required={true}>
  Webhook or websocket URL to send the collected digits or speech to; may be either an absolute or relative URL (see note below).  
  In the case of webhooks, this will be sent in a POST request.  
  [See below](#actionhook-properties) for payload details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="actionHookDelayAction" type="object" required={false}>
  An object [describing behaviors](/guides/features/handling-action-hook-delays) to apply if the webhook or websocket application delays in responding to the `actionHook`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="bargein" type="boolean" required={false}>
  Boolean indicating whether to allow barge-in when collecting speech (i.e., kill audio playback if the caller begins speaking).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dtmfBargein" type="boolean" required={false}>
  Boolean indicating whether to allow barge-in using DTMF keys.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fillerNoise" type="object" required={false} deprecated={true}>
  An object describing audio to play to the caller if the webhook or websocket application delays in responding to the `actionHook`.  
  (Deprecated in favor of `actionHookDelay`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fillerNoise.enable" type="boolean" required={true} deprecated={true}>
  Whether to enable or disable filler noise.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fillerNoise.startDelaySecs" type="number" required={true} deprecated={true}>
  Integer value specifying the number of seconds to wait for a response from the remote application.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fillerNoise.url" type="string" required={true} deprecated={true}>
  HTTP(S) URL to audio to play as filler noise.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="finishOnKey" type="string" required={false}>
  A DTMF key that, if received, indicates the end of DTMF input.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="input" type="array" required={false} default="['digits']">
  Array specifying allowed types of input: `['digits']`, `['speech']`, or `['digits', 'speech']`.  
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="interDigitTimeout" type="number" required={false}>
  Amount of time in seconds to wait between digits after `minDigits` have been entered.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="listenDuringPrompt" type="boolean" required={false} default="true">
  If `false`, do not listen for user speech until the nested `say` or `play` command has completed.  
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="maxDigits" type="number" required={false}>
  Maximum number of DTMF digits expected to gather.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="minBargeinWordCount" type="number" required={false} default="1">
  If `bargein` is `true`, only kill speech when this many words are spoken OR a final transcription is returned.  
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="minDigits" type="number" required={false} default="1">
  Minimum number of DTMF digits expected to gather.  
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="numDigits" type="number" required={false}>
  Exact number of DTMF digits expected to gather.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="partialResultHook" type="string" required={false}>
  Webhook to send interim transcription results to.  
  Partial transcriptions are only generated if this property is set.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="play" type="object" required={false}>
  Nested [`play`](/verbs/verbs/play) verb that can be used to prompt the user with an audio file.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="recognizer" type="object" required={false}>
  Speech recognition options to override default settings if desired.  
  See [`recognizer`](/verbs/verbs/recognizer).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="say" type="object" required={false}>
  Nested [`say`](/verbs/verbs/say) command that can be used to prompt the user with text-to-speech.
</ParamField>

<Note>
The `actionHook` property may be either an absolute URL or a relative URL. 
If it is a relative URL, it will be resolved relative to the base URL of the jambonz application.
Generally speaking, you will typically use a relative URL for the `actionHook` property, and when using websockets you
are strongly encouragedto use a relative URL.
</Note>

### actionHook properties

The payload sent to the `actionHook` URL will always include a `reason` property with one of the following values:
- `speechDetected` - user speech was collected
- `dtmfDetected` - user dtmf entries were collected
- `stt-low-confidence` - user speech was collected but the confidence level was below the threshold
- `timeout` - neither speech nor dtmf was collected before the timeout expired
- `error` - an error occurred during the gather operation, possibly with the speech recognizer

Depending on the reason, additional properties may be included in the payload.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="speechDetected">
    A `speech` object will be included in the payload.  The `speech` object will include the following properties:
    - `language_code` - the detected language that was spoken
    - `is_final` - a boolean indicating whether this was a final or interim transcription
    - `channel_tag` - a value of 1 if the transcription is from the caller, or 2 if from the callee
    - `alternatives` - an array of alternative transcriptions, each with a `transcript` and `confidence` value
    - `vendor` - the raw payload returned from the speech vendor

  <Accordion title="dtmfDetected">
    A `digits` property will be included in the payload containing the digits that were collected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="stt-low-confidence">
    A `speech` object will be included, see `speechDetected`for an example.  The reason `stt-low-confidence` 
    indicates to the application that this transcript should be treated with caution as it is likely to 
    be an inaccurate reporting of what the user actually said.
