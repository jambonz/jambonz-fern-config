When collecting speech input, the default recognizer for the application will be used unless you 
overridde it by specifying a [recognizer](/verbs/verbs/recognizer) property, as shown above.

You can use the following options in the `gather` command:

| option        | description | required  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| actionHook | Webhook or websocket URL to send the collected digits or speech to; may be either an absolute or relative URL (see note below).  In the case of webhooks, this will be sent in a POST request.  [See below](#actionhook-payload) for payload details.| yes |
|actionHookDelayAction|an object [describing behaviors](/guides/features/handling-action-hook-delays) to apply if the webhook or websocket application delays in responding to the actionHook.|no|
| bargein | boolean indicating whether to allow bargein when collecting speech (i.e. kill audio playback if caller begins speaking).| no |
| dtmfBargein | boolean indicating whether to allow bargein using dtmf keys.| no |
| finishOnKey | A dmtf key that if received indicates the the end of dtmf input.| no |
| input |array, specifying allowed types of input: ['digits'], ['speech'], or ['digits', 'speech'].  Default: ['digits'] | no |
| interDigitTimeout | Amount of time in seconds to wait between digits after minDigits have been entered.| no |
|listenDuringPrompt| booleanm if false means do not listen for user speech until the nested say or play command has completed.  Defaults to true.|no|
| minBargeinWordCount | if bargein is true, only kill speech when this many words are spoken OR a final transcripion is returned,  Defaults to 1 | no|
| minDigits | Minimum number of dtmf digits expected to gather.  Defaults to 1. | no |
| maxDigits | Maximum number of dtmf digits expected to gather | no |
| numDigits | Exact number of dtmf digits expected to gather | no |
| partialResultHook | Webhook to send interim transcription results to. Partial transcriptions are only generated if this property is set. | no |
| play | nested [play](/verbs/verbs/play) verb that can be used to prompt the user with an audio file. | no |
| say | nested [say](/verbs/verbs/say) Command that can be used to prompt the user with text to speech.| no |
| fillerNoise | an object describing audio to play to the caller if the webhook or websocket application delays in responding to the actionHook. (Deprecated in favor of actionHookDelay)| no |
| fillerNoise.enable | boolean, whether to enable or disable filler noise. | yes |
| fillerNoise.url | http(s) audio to play as filler noise. | yes |
| fillerNoise.startDelaySecs | integer value specifying number of seconds to wait for a response from the remote application| yes |
| [recognizer](/verbs/verbs/recognizer)|  Speech recognition options to override default settings if desired. | no |

<Note>
The `actionHook` property may be either an absolute URL or a relative URL. 
If it is a relative URL, it will be resolved relative to the base URL of the jambonz application.
Generally speaking, you will typically use a relative URL for the `actionHook` property, and when using websockets you
are strongly encouragedto use a relative URL.
</Note>

### actionHook payload

The payload sent to the `actionHook` URL will always include a `reason` property with one of the following values:
- `speechDetected` - user speech was collected
- `dtmfDetected` - user dtmf entries were collected
- `stt-low-confidence` - user speech was collected but the confidence level was below the threshold
- `timeout` - neither speech nor dtmf was collected before the timeout expired
- `error` - an error occurred during the gather operation, possibly with the speech recognizer

Depending on the reason, additional properties may be included in the payload.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="speechDetected">
    A `speech` object will be included in the payload.  The `speech` object will include the following properties:
    - `language_code` - the detected language that was spoken
    - `is_final` - a boolean indicating whether this was a final or interim transcription
    - `channel_tag` - a value of 1 if the transcription is from the caller, or 2 if from the callee
    - `alternatives` - an array of alternative transcriptions, each with a `transcript` and `confidence` value
    - `vendor` - the raw payload returned from the speech vendor

  <Accordion title="dtmfDetected">
    A `digits` property will be included in the payload containing the digits that were collected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="stt-low-confidence">
    A `speech` object will be included, see `speechDetected`for an example.  The reason `stt-low-confidence` 
    indicates to the application that this transcript should be treated with caution as it is likely to 
    be an inaccurate reporting of what the user actually said.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="timeout">
    No additional properties will be included in the payload.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="error">
    A `details` property will be included in the payload with a description of the error.
