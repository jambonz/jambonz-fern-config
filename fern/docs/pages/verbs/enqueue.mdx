## Parameters

<ParamField path="actionHook" type="string" required={false}>
  A webhook invoked when the operation completes.  
  - If a call is dequeued through the `leave` verb, the webhook is immediately invoked.  
  - If the call has been bridged to another party via the `dequeue` verb, then the webhook is invoked after both parties have disconnected.

  See below for specified request parameters.
</ParamField>

  Calls are dequeued in priority order, lowest to highest.  
  Default: 999.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="waitHook" type="string" required={false}>
  A webhook to invoke while the caller is in queue.  
  The only allowed verbs in the application returned from this webhook are `say`, `play`, `pause`, and `leave`.  
  See below for additional request parameters.
