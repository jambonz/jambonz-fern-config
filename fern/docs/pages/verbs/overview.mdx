Verbs are the fundamental building blocks of your jambonz application, they instruct the platform how to handle the call.

## Interaction
jambonz controls calls through the use of JSON payloads that are exchanged either over an webhook or a websocket connection.  
When an incoming call for your account is received, jambonz retrieves the URL that you have configured for the application you want to run.  
If the URL begins with 'http(s)://' jambonz makes an http request to the URL, while if the URL starts with 'ws(s)://' jambonz establishes a websocket connection to that URL. 
jambonz then sends an initial message describing the incoming call, and your webapp is then responsible for returning a JSON payload that indicates how you want the call handled.

Either way (http or websocket) the details of the JSON payloads are the same.  

When an incoming call for your account is received, jambonz makes an HTTP request to a URL that you have configured and your webapp will then return a response containing a JSON body that indicates how you want the call handled.

> You can develop your webapp using whatever language or framework you like, but the quickest way to scaffold up a webapp is by using our [Node.js framework](http://localhost:3000/docs/sdks/nodeclient)

If you want to generate an outbound call it works similarly: you will make an HTTP request using the [REST API](/reference/rest-call-control/calls/create-call) and in it you will specify a URL or application identifier that will be invoked once the call is answered.  Once again, your response to that HTTP request will contain a JSON body that indicates how you want the call handled.

## Basic JSON message structure
The JSON payload that you provide in response to an HTTP request must be an array with each item describing a task that the platform shall perform.  These tasks are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array.  Each task is identified by a verb (e.g. "dial", "gather", "hangup" etc) with associated detail to configure how the action should be carried out.

If the caller hangs up during the execution of an application for that call, the current task is allowed to complete and any remaining tasks in the application are ignored.

```json
[
  {
    "verb": "say",
    "text": "Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone.",
    "synthesizer": {
      "vendor": "Google",
      "language": "en-US",
      "gender": "FEMALE"
    }
  },
  {
    /* ..next verb */
  }
]
```

Some verbs allow other verbs to be nested; e.g. "gather" can have a nested "say" command in order to play a prompt and collect a response in one command:

```json
{
  "verb": "gather",
  "actionHook": "/gatherCardNumber",
  "input": ["speech", "dtmf"],
  "timeout": 16,
  "numDigits": 6,
  "recognizer": {
    "vendor": "Google",
    "language": "en-US"
  },
  "say": {
    "text": "Please say or enter your six digit card number now",
    "synthesizer": {
      "vendor": "Google",
      "language": "en-US",
      "gender": "FEMALE"
    }
  }
}
```

Altogether then, a simple voicemail application could look like this:
```json
[
  {
    "verb": "say",
    "text": "Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly."
  },
  {
    "verb": "listen",
    "actionHook": "http://example.com/voicemail",
    "url": "wss://example.com/my-recorder",
    "finishOnKey": "#",
    "metadata": {
      "topic": "voicemail"
    },
    "playBeep": true,
    "timeout": 20
  },
  {
    "verb": "say",
    "text": "Thanks for your message.  We'll get back to you"
  }
]
```
