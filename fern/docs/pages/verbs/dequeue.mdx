title: Dequeue
subtitle: Removes the lowest priority call from a specified queue and bridges that call to the current caller.
hide-toc: true

<Note>
Calls can optionally be [enqueued](/verbs/verbs/enqueue) with priority values that will dictate how they are ordered in the queue.  If priorities are not specified then the queue will operate in FIFO order.
</Note>

```json
{
  "verb": "dequeue",
  "name": "support",
  "beep": true,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

You can use the following options in the `dequeue` command:

| option        | description | required  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| name | name of the queue | yes |
| callSid | a specific call to dequeue; if not provided the lowest priority call or the call at the head of the queue will be dequeued | no|
| actionHook | A webhook invoke when call ends. If no webhook is provided, execution will continue with the next verb in the current application. <br/>See below for specified request parameters.| no |
| beep | if true, play a beep tone to this caller only just prior to connecting the queued call; this provides an auditory cue that the call is now connected | no |
| timeout | number of seconds to wait on an empty queue before returning (default: wait forever) | no |

The *actionHook* webhook will contain a `dequeueResult` property indicating the completion reason:

- 'hangup' - the bridged call was abandoned while listening to the confirmHook message
- 'complete' - the call was successfully bridged and ended with a caller hangup
- 'timeout' - no call appeared in the named queue during the timeout interval
- 'error' - a system error of some kind occurred
