title: Dequeue
subtitle: Removes the lowest priority call from a specified queue and bridges that call to the current caller.
---

<Note>
Calls can optionally be [enqueued](/verbs/verbs/enqueue) with priority values that will dictate how they are ordered in the queue.  If priorities are not specified then the queue will operate in FIFO order.
</Note>

```json
{
  "verb": "dequeue",
  "name": "support",
  "beep": true,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required={true}>
  name of the queue
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="callSid" type="string" required={false}>
  a specific call to dequeue; if not provided, the lowest priority call or the call at the head of the queue will be dequeued
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="actionHook" type="string" required={false}>
  A webhook invoked when the call ends. If no webhook is provided, execution will continue with the next verb in the current application.  
  See below for specified request parameters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="beep" type="boolean" required={false}>
  if true, play a beep tone to this caller only just prior to connecting the queued call; this provides an auditory cue that the call is now connected
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="timeout" type="number" required={false}>
  number of seconds to wait on an empty queue before returning (default: wait forever)
</ParamField>

### actionHook properties

The *actionHook* webhook will contain a `dequeueResult` property indicating the completion reason:

- **'hangup'** - the bridged call was abandoned while listening to the confirmHook message  
- **'complete'** - the call was successfully bridged and ended with a caller hangup  
- **'timeout'** - no call appeared in the named queue during the timeout interval  
- **'error'** - a system error of some kind occurred
