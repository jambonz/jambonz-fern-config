title: About the REST API
---
The jambonz REST API allows applications to query, create, and manage calls and other resources within the platform.

## API Endpoint

User of jambonz.cloud should use `https://jambonz.cloud/api` as the base URL for all REST API requests, if you are self hosting your own instance of jambonz then you will need to use the value for your API server.

## Authentication

The API uses Bearer authentication; i.e., a bearer token that must be provided in the Authorization header, e.g.

`Authorization: Bearer 'your-api-token'`

You can generate an api token for your account in the hosted portal.

## HTTP response codes

  POST requests will return a 201 status on success and a JSON payload that includes a sid property referencing the unique identifier of the resource that has been created.
  UPDATE and DELETE requests will return a 204 status on success with no body
  GET requests will return a 200 response with a JSON payload
