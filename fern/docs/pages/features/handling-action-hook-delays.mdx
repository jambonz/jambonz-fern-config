title: Handling delays in bots
subtitle: Provide feedback to users while backend processing is happening
hidden: false
---

When the [gather verb](/verbs/verbs/gather) collects a user utterance and submits it to the jambonz webhook or 
websocket application for processing, there may be a noticeable delay depending on what the back-end logic needs to do.  

For instance, it may need to update a CRM system, make an http request, or feed an LLM and wait for a response. 
Some of these operations may take a while to complete, and you may want to be able to provide a user with some calming 
feedback that this is normal system processing.

The actionhook delay feature provides a way to pre-program instructions on what to say or play 
something when these sorts of delays are experienced.  This feature is enabled by the `actionHookDelayAction` property 
in either the gather or [config](/verbs/verbs/config) verbs.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="actions" type="array" required={true}>
  An array of actions (`jambonz` verbs) to take when `noResponseTimeout` is triggered.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="enabled" type="boolean" required={true}>
  Enable or disable the `actionHookDelayAction` feature.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="noResponseGiveUpTimeout" type="number" required={false}>
  Length of time (in seconds) to give up and stop performing actions.  
  Default: `none`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="noResponseTimeout" type="number" required={false}>
  Length of delay (in seconds) that triggers an action.  
  Default: `0`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="retries" type="number" required={false}>
  Number of times to perform actions, with a `noResponseTimeout` between each retry.  
  Default: `1`.
</ParamField>
## Examples
#### Providing filler noise

A simple use case is to provide filler noise when a back end operation takes a long time.  Here, if the response takes longer than two seconds we play some typing sounds to the caller.

```json
{
  "verb": "gather",
  "actionHook": "/processUserUtterance",
  "actionHookDelayAction" : {
    "enabled": true,
    "noResponseTimeout": 2,
    "actions": [
      {
        "verb": "play",
        "url": "http://adfads/typing-sounds.mp3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Providing a series of prompts

A more complex use case would be to prompt multiple times as the delay gets longer, and then hang up the call if the bot does not respond in 20 seconds.

```json
{
  "verb": "config",
  "actionHookDelayAction" : {
    "enabled": true,
    "retries": 2,
    "noResponseTimeout": 5,
    "noResponseGiveupTimeout": 20,
    "actions": [
      {
        "verb": "say",
        "text": "Please hold while we complete your transaction"
      },
      {
        "verb": "say",
        "text": "Please continue to hold."
      }
    ]
  }
},
{
  "verb": "gather",
  "say": "Would you like us to book your flight now?",
  "input": ["speech"],
  "actionHook": "/processUserUtterance"
}
```

Note in the above that we have an array with two prompts.  The first is played after 5 seconds of delay and a different prompt is played if the user is still waiting for a response after 10 seconds.  If the delay reaches 20 seconds, then the call is terminated.
