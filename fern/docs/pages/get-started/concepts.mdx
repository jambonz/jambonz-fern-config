title: Introducing jambonz! 
subtitle: Overview and Concepts
---

jambonz is the open-source telephony platform for deploying Voice AI applications at scale.

What do we mean by that?  Well, it's..

- **Open-source**:  Offered under the [MIT license](https://tlo.mit.edu/understand-ip/exploring-mit-open-source-license-comprehensive-guide); 
it is white-labelable, easy to customize, and can run anywhere - use our cloud or deploy on your own infrastructure.
- **a telephony platform**: built by a team with extensive experience building scalable and reliable voice processing systems for some of the world's largest telecoms
- **for deploying Voice AI applications**: jambonz is a "bring your own everything" platform that integrates with the major speech and conversational AI vendors, 
allowing you to create low-latency speech and voice AI pipelines.
- **at scale**: jambonz is designed to be horizontally scalable, and can be deployed in a multi-tenant configuration to support many thousands of customers on a single system.

Through our customers and partners, jambonz is deployed today in many Fortune 500 companies 
as the underlying voice platform for conversational AI while also being used by SMBs and startups around the globe to deliver innovative voice applications.

## How it works

jambonz allows developers to build voice applications using a simple, declarative JSON-based language. 
Using either webhooks or websockets, developers interact with the jambonz platform to handle, create and manage calls.

When an incoming call arrives, jambonz will route the call to a user application based on information such as 
the dialed number or the incoming SIP trunk.  The application can then respond with a set of [verbs](http://localhost:3000/verbs/verbs/answer) 
that provide instructions to jambonz on how to handle the call.

jambonz also provides a [REST API](http://localhost:3000/reference/introduction) that allows developers to generate outbound dialing campaigns, modify a call 
in progress, or configure any aspect of the provisioned service.

The list of things you can do with jambonz is extensive, and includes things like:
- Perform speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS),
- Connect calls to speech LLMs such as OpenAI, Deepgram, Ultravox, and ElevenLabs
- Receive and send bidirectional streaming audio directly into a call,
- Create background audio tracks and layer them into a call,
- Record and transcribe calls and save directly to your own cloud storage,
- Manage conferences and call queues,
- Receive calls from webRTC and MS Teams users, 
- and much more.

## Platform architecture

jambonz can be deployed in a variety of physical configurations, from a single server to highly scalable cluster. 
Regardless of the deployment model, every jambonz system consists of the following components:
- a session border controller function
- a feature server function
- a mysql database
- a redis cache
- a web server
- monitoring and logging, including a grafana dashboard

### session border controller function
The session border controller (SBC) function is responsible for handling the signaling and media for all calls.
The SBC handles functions such as:
- sip registrations, 
- detection and deflection of SIP spam traffic, 
- authentication of incoming calls, 
- media transcoding, 
- SIPREC call / media forking, 
- and more.  

> Note: for customers that have their own SBCs, jambonz can be placed behind the customer's SBC if desired.

### feature server function
The features server is the focal point and workhorse of the jambonz system.  It is responsible for:
- handling incoming calls and routing them to the appropriate application,
- receiving verbs from the user application and processing them,
- connecting the incoming audio stream to external components such as speech recognition engines and LLMs, and
- managing the overall state of the call.

### mysql database
The mysql database contains all of the customer-provisioned data such as:
- phone numbers and SIP trunks,
- user applications,
- speech vendor selections and credentials, and
- user and account configurations.

The mysql database is a multi-tenant database that contain thousands of tenant accounts.

### redis cache
The redis cache is used to store transient data such as:
- sip registrations,
- call state information for calls in progress
- the current state of the jambonz clusters

### web server
The web server hosts the jambonz portal, REST API, and the grafana portal.

### monitoring and logging
The monitoring and logging components provide call detail storage and system metrics that are displayed in the 
grafana dashboards.
