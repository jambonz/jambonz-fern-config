---

The **Plant Store API** is designed to meet a variety of business needs, whether you run a small boutique plant shop or a large online store. Below are some common use cases that demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Plant Store API.

## Automating Inventory Management

Running out of stock can lead to lost sales, while overstocking can increase costs. With the Plant Store API, you can automate inventory management to keep your stock levels optimized.

**Example:**
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Set up automated notifications when a plant’s stock level drops below a certain threshold.
- **Reorder Automation**: Automatically trigger reorders from suppliers when stock levels fall below a predefined minimum.

```js
// Fetch plants with low stock
plantStore.getPlants({ stock: 'low' }).then(plants => {
  console.log('Plants low in stock:', plants);
});
```

This ensures that you never run out of your best-selling plants and can replenish inventory efficiently.

## Personalized Customer Experience

The Plant Store API allows you to store and track customer preferences, helping you provide a personalized shopping experience. You can offer tailored recommendations, promotions, and loyalty rewards based on a customer’s order history and preferences.

**Example:**
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest plants based on previous purchases or customer preferences.
- **Loyalty Program**: Reward frequent customers with points or discounts based on their purchase history.

```js
// Fetch customer data to offer personalized recommendations
plantStore.getCustomer('customer-id').then(customer => {
  console.log('Customer preferences:', customer.preferences);
});
```

This boosts customer satisfaction and increases the chances of repeat business.

## E-commerce Integration

For online stores, the Plant Store API enables smooth integration with e-commerce platforms, allowing for seamless order processing, payment handling, and shipping updates.

**Example:**
- **Order Management**: Automatically process and update order statuses, including payment confirmation and shipment tracking.
- **Discount Codes**: Easily apply promotional discounts to customer orders at checkout.

```js
// Create a new order and apply a discount code
plantStore.createOrder({
  customerId: 'customer-id',
  items: [
    { plantId: 'monstera-123', quantity: 1 },
    { plantId: 'ficus-456', quantity: 2 }
  ],
  discountCode: 'SPRINGSALE2024'
}).then(order => {
  console.log('Order placed:', order);
});
```

This ensures that the customer experience is smooth and efficient from order placement to delivery.

## In-Store and Online Promotion Management

Using the Plant Store API, you can manage promotional campaigns both online and in-store. Create discount codes, track the performance of promotions, and adjust marketing strategies based on real-time data.

**Example:**
- **Campaign Performance Tracking**: Monitor the effectiveness of sales campaigns and promotions to maximize ROI.
- **Targeted Promotions**: Offer special discounts to specific customer segments or during particular seasons.

```js
// Create a new discount code for a seasonal promotion
plantStore.createDiscountCode({
  code: 'WINTERSALE2024',
  discountPercent: 15,
  startDate: '2024-12-01',
  endDate: '2024-12-31'
}).then(discount => {
  console.log('New discount code created:', discount);
});
```

This helps you attract more customers and drive higher sales during key times.

## Handling Bulk Orders for Large Retailers

For larger retailers or nurseries, the Plant Store API provides the ability to handle bulk orders efficiently, ensuring a smooth and scalable operation.

**Example:**
- **Bulk Order Processing**: Accept and process bulk orders from wholesale customers, allowing you to sell large quantities of plants efficiently.
- **Automated Invoicing**: Generate and send invoices automatically when bulk orders are placed.

```js
// Process a bulk order for a large retailer
plantStore.createBulkOrder({
  customerId: 'wholesale-customer-id',
  items: [
    { plantId: 'succulent-789', quantity: 100 },
    { plantId: 'cactus-123', quantity: 50 }
  ]
}).then(order => {
  console.log('Bulk order processed:', order);
});
```

This allows you to scale your business operations smoothly without worrying about order management bottlenecks.
